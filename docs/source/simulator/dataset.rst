Dataset
=======

VMAgent is constructed based on one month real VM scheduling dataset called `Huawei-East-1 <https://vmagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulator/dataset.html>`__ from `HUAWEI Cloud <https://www.huaweicloud.com>`__.
The `Huawei-East-1 <https://github.com/mail-ecnu/VMAgent/blob/master/vmagent/data/Huawei-East-1.csv>`__ is placed in our repository.

Data Format
--------------------

The data format is concluded below 

==========    ==================================== ===============================================
Field         Type                                 Description
==========    ==================================== ===============================================
``vmid``      ``int``                              The virtual machine ID
``cpu``       ``int``                              Number of CPU cores
``memory``    ``int``                              Number of Memory GBs
``time``      ``int``                              Relative time in seconds  
``type``      ``int``                              0 denotes creation while 1 denotes deleteion
==========    ==================================== ===============================================

Notes
--------------------
In fact, some small-sized hosts in the dataset are virtual machine instances for internal and special users. These virtual machines share CPU resources, and the sharing ratio is between 1/4 and 1/2. 
The proportion for the sharing VMs is as follows:
=========     ===============
VM Type       proportion 
=========     ===============
``2U4G``      ``65%`` 
``4U8G``      ``75%`` 
``8U16G``     ``60%`` 
``1U2G``      ``90%`` 
``4U16G``     ``90%`` 
``1U1G``      ``90%`` 
``2U8G``      ``90%`` 
``8U32G``     ``90%`` 
``1U4G``      ``90%`` 
=========     ===============

VMAgent finally uses the middle value of 1/3 for simulation (It means that each core CPU of virtual machine only uses 1/3 core CPU of the actual physical host).


Statistical Analysis
--------------------

The statsical information of the dataset is listed below.

================== =========================== =========================== ============= ===============
Number of VM types Number of creation requests Number of deletion requests Time duration Server location
================== =========================== =========================== ============= ===============
15                 125430                      116313                      30 Days       East China
================== =========================== =========================== ============= ===============

To gain better understanding of the cpu and memory distribution, we plot the histograms of the cpu and memory.

.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/cpu.png
   :alt: cpu

.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/mem.png
   :alt: mem

To see the length of different requests, we plot the curve of the lifetime:
.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/lifetime.png
   :alt: lifetime

More than 2/3 requests only consumes 1U and less than 2G. We also plot the statiscs of the (cpu, mem) request:

.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/vm_type.png
   :alt: vmtype

The 1U1G,1U2G, 2U4G and 4U8G constitues the main body of the requests.

We also visualize the dynamic of virtual machine during the month:

.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/alive_vms.png
   :alt: alives

Although there exists deletion request, the number of alive virtual machines increses from 0 to more than 8000. It
should be noted that, even in the one month, the VMâ€™s dynamic is highly related to the time.
``Increase, Flux, Increase, Flux`` happens through the one month.

.. figure:: ../images/scenarios/cpu_mem.png
   :alt: cpu-mem

We also visualize the allocated cpu and memory dynamic above. They can be helpful in constructing domain knowledge.

Naive Baselines performance
---------------------------

Another way to describe the dataset is measuring performance of naive baselines in the dataset. We adopt First-Fit and
Best-Fit as the naive baselines and conduct experiments on different settings.

We conduct fading and recovering experiments with 5, 20, 50 servers and each server has 40 cpu and 90 memeory.
